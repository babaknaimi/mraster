## mraster: mapping memory to raster files

A package that provides the functionalities to map the memory into a raster/image file, and get random access to the specified pixels. This is specially useful when the image is big as it cannot fit in the memory.

The package is under construction, and will be updated eventually.

To install the current version, use install_github from the devtools package:

```r
devtools::install_github("babaknaimi/mraster")
```
